% ITCHES IN ME BRITCHES %
\song{Itches In Me Britches}{trad. (after the Poxy Boggards' version)}

I was born of Geordie parents\\
One day when I was young,\\
That's how the Geordie dialect\\
Became my native tongue.\\
That I was a pretty baby\\
Me mother, she would vow;\\
The girls all ran to kiss me then,\\
I wish they'd do it now\\
\\
\chorusmarker
Oh, I wish they'd do it now (2x)\\
I've got itches in me britches\\
And I wish they'd do it now\\
\\
When I was only six months old\\
The girls would handle me;\\
They'd hug me to their bosom\\
And they'd bounce me on their knee;\\
They'd put me in the cradle,\\
And if I made a row,\\
They'd tickle me, they'd cuddle me,\\
I wish they'd do it now\\
\\
At three years old a finer lad\\
There never could be seen;\\
The girls all loved to follow me\\
Right down to the green.\\
They'd make a chain of buttercups,\\
Drop it on me brow,\\
Then they'd roll me in the clover,\\
Well, I wish they'd do it now\\
\\
The East End girls would call on me\\
To swim when it was mild;\\
They'd take me to the river\\
For to splash about a while;\\
They'd throw the water over me,\\
Duck me like a cow,\\
Then they'd rub me nice all over,\\
Well, I wish they'd do it now.\\

% MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB %
\song{Mary Had a Little Lamb}{trad. (Civil War)}
\chorusmarker
Hurrah for Mary, hurrah for the Lamb!\\
Hurrah for the Union boys who did not give a damn!\\
And everywhere that Mary went the Lamb was sure to go,\\
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!\\

% WALTZING WTIH BEARS %
\song{Waltzing With Bears}{by Dr. Seuss (lyrics) \& Eugene Poddany (tune), folk processed by Priscilla Herdman and others}

I went to his room in the middle of the night,\\
Crept to his side and I turned on the light,\\
But to my surprise there was no one in sight,\\
‘Cause my Uncle Walter goes waltzing at night!\\
\\
\chorusmarker
He goes wa-wa-wa wa-wa-wa-waltzing with bears.\\
Raggy bears, shaggy bears, baggy bears too.\\
And there's nothing on earth Uncle Walter won't do!\\
So he can go waltzing, go wa-wa-wa-waltzing,\\
So he can go waltzing, go waltzing with bears.\\
\\
We bought Uncle Walter a new suit to wear,\\
But when he came home it was covered with hair,\\
And lately I've noticed there's several new tears!\\
I’m afraid Uncle Walter's been waltzing with bears!\\
\\
We told Uncle Walter that he should be good,\\
And do all the things that we said that he should,\\
But I know that he'd rather be off in the woods!\\
I'm afraid that we’ll lose Uncle Walter for good!\\
\\
We begged and we pleaded “Oh please won’t you stay?”\\
And managed to keep him at home for a day.\\
But the bears all barged in and they took him away!\\
Now he's dancing with pandas and he won’t understand us\\
And the bears all demand at least one dance a day!\\

% WHO'S GONNA SHOE %
\song{Who's Gonna Shoe Your Pretty Little Foot?}{trad., fixed by Sophia Donforth \& Emily Steele Hurst}

Who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot,\\
who's gonna glove your hand,\\
who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips,\\
who's gonna be your man?\\
\\
Papa's gonna shoe my pretty little foot,\\
Mama's gonna glove my hand,\\
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,\\
I don't need no man.\\
\\
I don't need no man (2x)\\
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,\\
I don't need no man.\\
\\
Who's gonna change the oil in your car,\\
who's gonna kill those bugs,\\
who's gonna walk you home late at night\\
and see you don't get mugged?\\
\\
I'm gonna change the oil in my car,\\
I'm gonna squish those bugs,\\
I'll walk with defiance and I won't be afraid\\
and I bet I won't get mugged.\\
\\
I don't need no man (2x)\\
I'll walk with defiance and I won't be afraid,\\
I don't need no man.\\
\\
Who's gonna fix my meals for me,\\
who's gonna clean my house,\\
who's gonna keep me sweet company,\\
who's gonna be my mouse?\\
\\
You can learn to cook, you can learn to bake,\\
you can clean your own damn house,\\
you can talk yourself through your lonesomeness,\\
I ain't no one's mouse.\\
\\
I ain't no one's mouse (2x)\\
you can talk yourself through your lonesomeness\\
I ain't no one's mouse.\\
\\
I don't need no man (2x)\\
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,\\
I don't need no man.\\

% THE WIDOW AND THE DEVIL %
\song{The Widow and the Devil}{by Mick Ryan (after The Poozies' version)}
\chorusmarker
And the wind blew cold and lonely across that widow’s moore;\\
She never ever turned away a traveler from her door.
